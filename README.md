## How have we done it?
<hr>
Firstly we did our wireframe of the project to have an idea of how it was going to be when we were going to do the HTML archive. To do so, we used FIGMA


<h3>Button to add a student or another grade</h3>

<b>After this we created our HTML archive with CSS along with bootstrap, in order to have a fast stylization</b>
